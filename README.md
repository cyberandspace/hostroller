# Alright now, introducing The Hostname Roller v 0.1 !
# A script to make your hostname look like a generic Windows or MacBook machine.
# In combination with the Macbot v 0.3 script it provides the ability to spoof
# the trace you leave on a (public) network.
#
#
# NEEDED PREREQUISITES:
# 
# - A wordlist from http://www.outpost9.com/files/wordlists/Given-Names.zip
#   that you need to copy to your /usr/share/dict/ directory for the script 
#   work. 
#
# - The file /usr/share/dict/american-english need to be present, too.
#
# - Also to start system services etc. you need to be root, or sudo the script
#
